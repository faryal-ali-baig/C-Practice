# C++ Practice Programs

This repository contains my practice programs in C++ while learning programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## Topics Covered
- Variables & Data Types
- Operators & Control Structures
- Loops
- Functions
- Classes & Objects
- Constructors
- Static Data Members & Static Member Functions
## Example Programs
- **Pass by Value:** A copy of the variable is passed. Changes inside the function do NOT affect the original variable.
- **Pass by Reference:** The function works with the original variable directly. Changes inside the function DO affect the original variable.
- [PassByValue.cpp](Functions/PassByValue.cpp) → Demonstrates pass-by-value (original variable remains unchanged)
- [PassByValue.cpp](Functions/PassByValue.cpp) → Demonstrates pass-by-value (original variable remains unchanged)
- [PassByReference.cpp](Functions/PassByReference.cpp) → Demonstrates pass-by-reference (original variable is modified)
- Swap.cpp → Demonstrates Pass by Value vs Pass by Reference (swap example)
- Student.cpp → Class & Object example
- Loops.cpp → Print numbers 1–10
- Calculator.cpp → Simple calculator
- Rectangle.cpp → Area & Perimeter using class
- Fibonacci.cpp → Fibonacci series
- StaticExamples/StudentCounter.cpp → Demonstrates static data member & static member function
- StaticExamples/EmployeeTracker.cpp → Counts total employees using static members
- [Array of Object (Book Program)](book.cpp)
- [Passing Object as Function Argument (Time Program)] (time_add.cpp)
- [Friend Function (Rectangle area program)] (friend_function_rectangle.cpp)
- [Friend Class (Box volume program)] (friend_class_box.cpp)
 








## How to Run
Compile and run using g++:
